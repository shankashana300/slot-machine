Explaination:
    Simplified ver:
        There are 3 reels and each 1 reel has 3 symbols.
        In this project, there are 3 lines (also known as rows) pretaining to the reels.
        A player can only win if 3 symbols matches in a row per reel including a varying multiplier.
        Betting can be allowed only to certain amount of lines.
        With that said:
            for e.g.:
            * Player bets 1$ on 2 lines, then it's 2$ in total and depending on matching symbols on any of the 2 lines, Bet*varying multiplier.
